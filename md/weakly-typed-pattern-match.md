# Weakly Typed Pattern Match

Traditional Pattern Match strats offers flexible and safe flow control organisms. However, we often need _existentials_ for extensible and safe design and implementation. This is where pattern match strikes failure.

A easy resolution of this issue is to allow matching an existential upon every type constructor that provides evidence of the quantifications.
